# Intro to the Web Workshop: Your Food Blog!

**To get started, open this in Stackblitz**: [https://stackblitz.com/edit/oasis-workshop-3-website?file=README.md](https://stackblitz.com/edit/oasis-workshop-3-website?file=README.md)

*Make sure you press Fork in Stackblitz to copy the project!!*

**If Stackblitz gives you trouble, you can also use Codepen** [https://codepen.io/](https://codepen.io/)

In this folder, you will create your own interactive personal site! As you may have noticed, no starter files have been provided. It is up to you to create them and fill them in using your IDE

**Hint: in most IDE's, such as VS Code, you can click on a folder (so in this case, the folder 'website') and you should get an option for "New File". In Stackblitz there is a "New File" button in the "Files" header

You will want three files for this site: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `index.js`. Note that while you generally should call the home page of your site `index.html` by convention, you can call your CSS and JavaScript files whatever you want.

This site will have various features:

* A main title, that is your website, and the text is in your favorite color
* Your most flattering picture of you to introduce yourself
* A short description of your blog
* A button that will greet the visitor of your site upon pressing it
* A list of entires
	* Each entry should have a **header** title, a short **paragraph** description, an accompanying **image**, a **link** to a recipe, and (optionally) a **button** that will **alert** a joke about the food when pressed
* Some footer text at the bottom of the page
* Anything else you want!

This may not be the most attractive page on the web. But it will be your own, and that's all that counts. Good luck!

## Tips for Getting Started

1. Start by making your three files: "index.html, style.css, and index.js"
2. Start by writing the HTML
3. **Feel free** (in fact, we encourage) you copy over contents from the files you already wrote OR the template.html file in the Github repo
4. Add styling next--again, refer back to your past stylesheets and/or copy from them
5. If you're making it interactive, add JS last. 
6. **Ask questions** if you have any
