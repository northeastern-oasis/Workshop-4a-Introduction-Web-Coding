# Intro to Web Coding: Intro

This folder contains the files to get you started writing your web code. 

`index.html`, which we will work with first, will contain the HTML code that will define the skeleton of your page (what it looks like, without styling). To view your site in the browser, open this file using your favorite browser! 

**note: the name "index.html" is a convention used as the default page of a site**

`styles.css` will contain the CSS code that changes what your HTML elements look like. To have it work, you will need to connect your CSS stylesheet to your HTML document using the <link> tag in the document <head> tag. This is already done for you, but when you create your own HTML file you will need to do this.

`index.js` will contain the JavaScript code that will work inside your page. It can display messages, ask for user input, or even change elements on the page. To have it work, you will need to connect your JavaScript code to your HTML document using the <script> tag in the document <head> tag. This is already done for you, but when you create your own HTML file you will need to do this.

Here's what we're going to do:

**Open this project in Stackblitz**: [https://stackblitz.com/edit/oasis-workshop-3-testing?file=index.html](https://stackblitz.com/edit/oasis-workshop-3-testing?file=index.html)

*Once in Stackblitz, make sure you hit Fork to copy this code*

**note: if you're using your own IDE (not Stackblitz), to see changes to your page while editing, save your changed files and refresh the page in your browser. We'd highly recommend you use Stackblitz though**


HTML:
1. Go through what's in the page (as a group)
2. Add a text heading to our HTML page. It can say whatever you want
3. Add two (2) paragraph below that heading. They can also say what you want, but should be longer than the heading
4. Add an image to your page. It can be a cute puppy image downloaded from the Internet or just a random photo from your desktop!

And this listing of all the tags!

At this point your site will be functional but pretty plain. Let's add some styling!

CSS:
1. Add CSS rules to make all headers orange and twice as large
2. Add a class to your first paragraph element: 'fun-text'
3. Add CSS rules to fun-text to make it pink and italicized
4. Add a class to your image element: 'rounded'
5. Add CSS rules to make this image rounded

Add this point your site looks a little less plain, perhaps a little funkier! But we can't really interact with it in any way. Let's change that!

JavaScript:
1. In the function we have created, we're going to add some code to display a message to our user!
2. Using the "alert" function in JavaScript, we'll greet our user when they press a button
3. Add a new function that will change some text on your screen using document.getElementByID()
