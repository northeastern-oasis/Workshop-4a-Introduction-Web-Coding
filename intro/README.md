# Intro to Web Coding: Intro

This folder contains the files to get you started writing your web code. 

`index.html`, which we will work with first, will contain the HTML code that will define the skeleton of your page (what it looks like, without styling). To view your site in the browser, open this file using your favorite browser! 

**note: the name "index.html" is a convention used as the default page of a site**

`styles.css` will contain the CSS code that changes what your HTML elements look like. To have it work, you will need to connect your CSS stylesheet to your HTML document using the <link> tag in the document <head> tag. This is already done for you, but when you create your own HTML file you will need to do this.

`script.js` will contain the JavaScript code that will work inside your page. It can display messages, ask for user input, or even change elements on the page. To have it work, you will need to connect your JavaScript code to your HTML document using the <script> tag in the document <head> tag. This is already done for you, but when you create your own HTML file you will need to do this.

#### Linking HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

As we know, HTML is what we see on the screen but CSS and JavaScript let it do more. We need to link these files together to make this happen.

**CSS is linked to HTML** using the <style> tag. In index.html, this is seen on line 19. We tell this tag what the name of our CSS file is and it'll pull styles from it. We can also put styles inside our HTML file using the <style> tag.

**JavaScript is linked to HTML** using the <script> tag. In index.html, this is seen around line 31. We pass in the name of our JS file using the "src" attribute.

Here's what we're going to do:

**Open this project in Repl.it**: [https://repl.it/@chessmyers/NUWIT-Workshop-Intro-Web-Coding-Intro](https://repl.it/@chessmyers/NUWIT-Workshop-Intro-Web-Coding-Intro)

**note: if you're using your own IDE (not Repl.it), to see changes to your page while editing, save your changed files and refresh the page in your browser. We'd highly recommend you use Repl.it for this workshop though**

Go through the files in this order: index.html, style.css, script.js. Read all the comments and do the challenges to learn these languages!
