<!-- Your HTML code goes below! -->
<!-- This code will define what elements your page has (text, links, images, etc) -->
<!-- These lines are HTML comments, by the way. They don't do anything -->

<!-- This tag creates the document--you always start with this! -->
<html>
	<!-- This tag holds other tags that define metadata for the document, -->
	<!-- Like stylesheets used, JavaScript scripts used, page title, etc -->
	<!-- While not required, most pages will include it -->
	<head>
		<!-- This tag defines the title of the page -->
		<title>
			My page title
		</title>
		
		<!-- This <link> tag lets you link a CSS stylesheet to this HTML document -->
		<!-- the "href" value is the name of your CSS file! (or a file path to it if in a different folder)-->
		<!-- "rel=stylesheet" just tells the tag what kind of file you're linking-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
		
		<!-- This <script> tag lets you link JavaScript code to this document -->
		<!-- the "src" value is the name of your JavaScript file! (or a file path to it if in a different folder)-->
		<!-- "type=text/javascript" just tells the tag what kind of script you're connecting-->
		<script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>
		
	<!-- This closing tag ends the "head" tag -->
	</head>
	
	<!-- This tag holds the page content you can see -->
	<body>
	
		<!-- This tag creates a header element (text with big font) -->
		<!-- Notice you can put the opening tag, content, and closing tag on same line -->
		<h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
		
		<!-- This tag is a slightly smaller header, like a subheader. There's also <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6> -->
		<h2>Look at my page's subheading!</h2>
		
		<!-- This tag creates an image. It's 'src' property is the file path of the image (or just the name if it's in this folder). To get an image from the internet's source, right click on it and choose "Copy Image Path/Location" -->
		<img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ee6dafcba95a6485a2230d3/5f3a3cb0d19bbb865148a160_Logo_transparent-03-p-500.png" width=500 height=300 />
		
		<!-- This tag creates a link. It's href property is the URL to go to -->
		<a href="https://www.google.com">Link to Google!</a>
		
		<!-- This is a button, but clicking it won't do anything--we'll change that soon, though! -->
		<button>Click Me!</button>
		
		
		
		<!-- Now it's your turn! -->
		<!-- Try adding some new tags to your page! -->

		<!-- A full list of the tags can be found here: -->
		<!-- https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp -->
		<!-- By the way, DON'T worry about memorizing all or even many of these--there's no need! -->


		<!-- For a challenge, you can also try the following steps: -->
		<!-- 1. Add a new text heading to your HTML page that greets users. It can say whatever you want -->
		<!-- 2. Add two (2) paragraph below that heading. They can also say what you want (joke, poem, your manifesto) -->
		<!-- 3. Add a new image to your page. It can be a cute puppy image downloaded from the Internet or just a random photo from your desktop! -->
		<!-- 4. Add a link to your favorite site -->
		<!-- 5. Challenge: Add a table to your page (like Excel-style) -->
		<!-- If you finish, keep testing out tags! -->
