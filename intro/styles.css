/* Also DON'T worry about trying to memorize all these--literally nobody does! We just Google it! */

/* For an exercise, you can try: */
/* 1. Add CSS rules to make all headers orange and twice as large */
/* 2. Add a class to your first paragraph element: 'fun-text' */
/* 3. Add CSS rules to fun-text to make it pink and italicized */
/* 4. Add a class to your image element: 'rounded' */
/* 5. Add CSS rules to make this image rounded */

/* This styles all h1 elements in your HTML, no matter what class they have */
h1 {
	/* This makes our font color blue */
	color: blue;
	
	/* This doubles the size of our font */
	font-size: 200%;
	
	/* Now add your own or change the ones above! (Check out links above) */
	
	
	
}

/* This styles all HTML elements with the class 'fun-text' */
.fun-text {
	
}
